## Write those questions on paper first, then code them in your IDE.
## How To turn in your homework, 
1. Create a directory with your initial, no space, e.g. MG_Unit1_Homework
2. push your commmit and create a pull request to Homework Directory.

## Problems.
1.   Using the Point class, create two Point objects, using both constructors. Output the points. Move the points and then find the distance between the points using the Math.sqrt method. Output the two Point objects and the calculated distance.

2.  Using the Dice class, create two Dice objects using the no-arg constructor. Roll the dice and output their face value and their sum. 

3. Write a program that will allow the user to input a String and will output the String with quotes around it. You will need to use the escape sequence \" to append a quote.
str1 = "\"" + str1 + "\"";

Example 1

Enter a string: Hello
"Hello"

Example 2

Enter a string: CS Rocks!
"CS Rocks!"


4. Write a program that will allow the user to input an odd-length String and then will print out the String and its middle character.
    
Example 1

Enter a string: Juniper
The middle character of Hello is i.

Example 2
Enter a string: CS Rocks!
The middle character of CS Rocks! is o.


5. Write a program that will allow the user to input a String with at least three characters. The String must begin and end with a non-space character and must contain exactly one space between the first and last characters. Print the characters before the space on one line and the characters after the space on the next line. Use the Scanner nextLine method to read the String.
   
Example 1

Enter a string: Juniper Honeysuckle
Characters before the space: Juniper
Characters after the space: Honeysuckle

Example 2
Enter a string: CS Rocks!
Characters before the space: CS
Characters after the space: Rocks!


5. Write a program that will allow the user to input a String and randomly print one of its characters. Use Math.random to generate the index of the printed character.
   
7. Write a program that will allow the user to enter a String that has two or more eâ€™s in it. Print the index of the second e. Assume the String contains only lowercase e's.
   
Example 1

Enter a string: Honeysuckle
Index of the second e:10

Example 2
Enter a string: excellent
Index of the second e:3

8. Write a program that will allow the user to input two strings and determine if the two strings are equal using the equals method. Create the strings using the String constructor.
   
Example 1

Enter the first string: EGGS
Enter the second string: eggs
EGGS equals eggs is false.

Example 2
Enter the first string: joy
Enter the second string: joy
joy equals joy is true.


9. Write a program that will allow the user to input a string and determine if the first and last characters of the string are the same.
    
Example 1

Enter a string: EGGS
The first letter: E
The last letter: S
E equals S is false.

Example 2
Enter a string: abba
The first letter: a
The last letter: a
a equals a is true.


10. Write a program that will allow the user to input two strings and output the result of a call to the compareTo method. Use the first input string to call the compareTo method and the second input string as the parameter.
    
Example 1

Enter the first string: computer
Enter the second string: science
The result of the compareTo method: -16

Example 2
Enter the first string: Juniper
Enter the second string: Honeysuckle
The result of the compareTo method: 2


11. Write a program that will allow the user to input two integers and output the positive distance between them.
    
Example 1

Enter the first number: -2
Enter the second number: 10
The distance between -2 and 10 is 12.

Example 2
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: -1
The distance between 5 and -1 is 6.



12. Write a program that will allow the user to input two integers, num1 and num2, where 
num1 <= num2, the program prints a random number in the interval of [num1, num2].

Example 1

Enter the first number: 1
Enter the second number: 10
A random number in the interval of [1, 10]: 4

Example 2
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 25
A random number in the interval of [5, 25]: 18

NOTE: Any valid number in the interval is possible.

13. Write a program that will allow the user to input two doubles and output the first number raised to the power of the second number.
     
Example 1

Enter the base: 2.5
Enter the exponent: 2.0
2.5 ^ 2.0 = 6.25

Example 2
Enter the base: 5.0
Enter the exponent: 3.2
5.0 ^ 3.2 = 172.4662076826519
